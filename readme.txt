The Ising model, the Defuant model, networks and small world networks have all been implemented in the code file. For task 5, the Defuant model was combined with a small world network and then implemented into the program as well. As in task 5, when using the default values, not much change can be seen in the animation or on the mean. I have also included a plot of the range of opinions over time as this allows you to see that things are actually happening, it just works better with different values (like beta = 0.02, threshold = 0.4, size = 15).
It should be run via the terminal, if you are unsure which flags you can use, type -h after the python file name and it will detail them for you.
